Question 1
There is a comment saying " Wow! " in the switcher function in OSA1.c . This is to indicate something very bad is happening here. Explain what it is.

The free() function is not normally re-entrant and uses a static data structure to track free memory blocks.
As a result, it would be problematic in a multithreaded application and no library functions that allocate or free memory are reentrant. This includes functions that allocate space to store a result.
Without great care, it is easy to introduce memory leaks into the application code implemented using the free() and malloc() functions. This is caused by memory being allocated and never being deallocated. Such errors tend to cause a gradual performance degradation and eventual failure. This type of bug can be very hard to locate.

Question 2
Why are the time consuming calculations in threads3.c required in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pre-emptive scheduler?

Question 3
In threads3.c there is some code around the call to rand() to block signals and then allow them again.
Explain what can happen if this is not done. Also give an explanation as to why this can happen.
